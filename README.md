# Lox interpreter
A simple Lox interpreter, parsing `.lox` source files on the fly.
Lox is a basic language helping people learn interpreter design.
It is not really used outside this scope.

The interpreter uses `peg` for elegant and efficient parsing.
Writing my own parser was a terrible idea and I convinced myself
to elude the "bang my head on the table" moment.

There is no top-level instance for the moment, which may come later.

This project is a personal initiative, outside any school project.
