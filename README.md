# Lox interpreter
A simple Lox interpreter, parsing and executing `.lox` source files on the fly.

The interpreter uses `peg` for elegant and efficient parsing.
Writing my own parser was a terrible idea and I convinced myself
to elude the "bang my head on the table" moment.

This project is a personal initiative, outside any directed project.

# Lox
Lox is a dynamically-typed, imperative language with very few features (including OOP, (anonymous) functions, ...)
Lox is above all a basic language helping people learn interpreter design.
It is not really used outside this scope, and only serves this task. Indeed, its lack of features
makes it quite a weak language.
